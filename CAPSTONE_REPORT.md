**[DONE]** Step 2: Populated statistical data (CSV) with 100 real Premier League player names and created corresponding contextual reports.
**[DONE]** Step 3: Implemented the RAG pipeline setup (Loading, Splitting, Embedding, and Storing documents into a persistent Chroma Vector Database using OpenAI Embeddings).

- **[DONE]** Step 4 (Part 1): Implemented the core statistical tool, `get_statistical_match`, using Euclidean distance on normalized player data.
- **[DONE]** Step 4 (Part 2): Implemented the core LangGraph State and defined the initial nodes: `StatFinder` (Tool-Calling LLM), `Tool Executor`, and `RAG_Retriever`.
